# Overview

`changelog-gen` is a CHANGELOG generator intended to be used in conjunction
with [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) to
generate changelogs and create release tags from [conventional
commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) formatted commit
messages.

Reliance on `bump-my-version` for version management is being deprecated, and
brought in to `changelog_gen` to reduce the dependency chain, and allow more
control of versioning.

## Installation

```bash
pip install changelog-gen
```
